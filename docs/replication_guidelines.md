# Nobias Replication Guidelines

Replicability is one of the highest-weighted factors in Nobias scoring.

## Practices That Boost Replicability Score
- Direct links to open data (Zenodo, OSF, Figshare, Dryad)
- Public code repositories (GitHub, GitLab)
- Preregistration (OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Robustness checks (bootstrap, Monte Carlo, sensitivity analysis)
- Explicit replication statements

## Common Issues That Lower Score
- "Data available upon request"
- Proprietary/closed data
- No code shared
- Missing robustness reporting

## Best Practice Example
