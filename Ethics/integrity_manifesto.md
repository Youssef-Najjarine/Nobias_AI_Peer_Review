# Nobias Integrity Manifesto

**Science must be judged by evidence alone.**

We reject:
- Prestige as proxy for quality
- Institutional affiliation as signal of truth
- Suppression of anomalous results
- Overconfident claims without backing
- Black-box evaluation

We demand:
- Full transparency in every decision
- Explicit uncertainty where evidence is weak
- Self-auditing for intellectual honesty
- Replicability as a core value
- Protection of rigorous but unconventional work

Nobias exists to remove human gatekeeping and replace it with **provable integrity**.

The old system rewarded reputation.  
Nobias rewards evidence.

This is not reform.  
This is replacement.
