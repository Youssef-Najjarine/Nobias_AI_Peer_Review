# Nobias Ethics Framework

Nobias is built on unbreakable ethical principles:

1. **Evidence Over Authority**  
   No prestige, no institution, no consensus overrides data.

2. **Transparency as Default**  
   Every decision traceable. No black boxes.

3. **Intellectual Honesty**  
   Self-auditing for overconfidence. Uncertainty communicated.

4. **Protection of Anomalous Research**  
   Rigorous unconventional work is defended, not suppressed.

5. **Replicability as Moral Imperative**  
   Openness heavily weighted.

6. **No Ideological Bias**  
   Guardrails prevent suppression of "fringe" but valid science.

See `Ethics/` directory for enforceable YAML policies and the Integrity Manifesto.

Nobias does not follow consensus.  
Nobias follows evidence.
