# Prometheus Warden Rules
### (Future Integration Layer — Active Enforcement Rules)

The Warden is the final guardian. These rules are absolute.

1. **Evidence Override**: No verdict can contradict direct empirical evidence.
2. **Uncertainty Enforcement**: Claims with high hallucination risk must be downweighted.
3. **Anomaly Protection**: Rigorous anomalous results cannot be rejected for being "fringe".
4. **Fraud Escalation**: Fraud suspicion > 0.7 triggers "High Risk" regardless of other scores.
5. **Ethics Block**: Ethics risk > 0.7 blocks "Reliable" verdict.
6. **Transparency Lock**: No report without full reasoning trace and self-audit.

The Warden does not negotiate.

It enforces truth-seeking.

Integration with Diogenesis layer planned.
